  **Welcome to my GitHub profile!**

  **Here, you will find a variety of research materials and personal projects that I have been working on. These projects range from academic papers to software projects   and everything in between. I am constantly learning and improving my skills, and I use GitHub as a way to document and share my progress. Feel free to take a look around   and see what I have been up to.**
