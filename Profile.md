## About Me
The only difference between writing a book and creating a technological product is that, unlike myths and folks, It can be used by real people right away for the better of their advantage.

No matter what, I'm always curious to learn since I really believe that nothing is ever wasted. I've gained knowledge and expertise in a wide range of fields throughout the years, including front and back-end development, database administration, building REST APIs, desktop application development, photo and video editing, and who knows what else.

I am on a never-ending quest to study and create my own world, and the more I learn, the further I see how far I've come from where I used to be to where I am.
